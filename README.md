###### FLASK REACT ZAPPA TEMPLATE ######

1. Create and activate the venv: 'python -m venv venv' + 'source venv/bin/activate' 
2. Pip install the python libraries: 'python -m pip install -r requirements.txt'
3. Prepare AWS credentials locally: 
- Run 'aws configure --profile {PROFILE_NAME}' and input your public and secret access key (Retreive from aws console)
- Make sure that profile is set as default: 'export AWS_PROFILE={PROFILE_NAME}'
7. In zappa_settings.json, replace {PROJECT_NAME} and {AWS_PROFILE_NAME} with the correct values
5. Cd into frontend/ and then run 'npm ci'
6. Run 'npm run dev' and make sure the website is reachable
7. Go back to the root of the project and run 'bash local_deploy.sh' to test if the flask application is working
8. On the aws console, edit the newly created s3 bucket in the following ways:
- Set block all public access to OFF
- Set object ownership to ACLs enabled and bucket owner preferred
- In the ACL view, edit and check List to the right of 'Everyone (public access)'
- Finally add the following to the CORS section:
[
    {
        "AllowedHeaders": [
            "*"
        ],
        "AllowedMethods": [
            "GET",
            "HEAD"
        ],
        "AllowedOrigins": [
            "*"
        ],
        "ExposeHeaders": []
    }
]
9. Initialize the zappa dev application with 'zappa deploy dev'
10. Then in deploy_dev.sh and scripts/upload_static.py, replace {BUCKET_NAME} and {ENDPOINT} with the dev bucket and endpoint name. Then run 'bash deploy_dev.sh'
11. When you're ready, do steps 9+10 again but replace dev with prod.
